Overview 
A performance management system helps businesses track and evaluate employees' productivity. This provides managers with insightful feedback on areas to upskill workers to deliver quality on the job. Also, PMS lets managers align employees towards business objectives and identify potential bottlenecks that impede workers' performance.  

Why are we doing this? 

Managing and retaining top talent is challenging. PMS resolves this, clarifying how an employee's work syncs with the company’s goal. It helps workers understand the metrics that impact their performance and how to use them to execute tasks effectively.
PMS fosters a healthy, transparent, and stress-free workplace that boosts productivity. 






How do we know this is a real problem worth solving?


Research shows that businesses without PMS struggle to optimize their talent. Productivity may decline as workers lack a system with relevant metrics for tracking performance and identifying lapses at work. PMS empowers open and flexible work procedures, helping staff meet their professional objectives and upskill.   


Additionally, PMS provides valuable insights that will inform broader human capital management decisions.


How does this fit into the overall company objectives?

An end-to-end PMS caters for talent improvement from their recruitment into the company to their exit. Managers set SMART goals for employees via PMS to track and align individual efforts with company efforts.

Misalignment of employee goals

What are the user benefits? 

The user benefits of this product include but are not limited to

Boost consistency and reduce bias: In an organisation, a streamlined and automated procedure promotes consistency and minimises bias. You won't forget to conduct staff reviews or check-ins thanks to workflow automation, and data insights ensure that your decisions are unbiased and just.

Improved processes: The firm may determine whether staff training methods are effective with objectivity, a streamlined procedure, and data insights. A solid process depends on knowing which training packages are effective.

Retain employees: Strong manager-employee relationships, open lines of communication, and regular meetings all aid in coordinating employee goals with overall company goals. The likelihood that an employee will remain at their employment increases when they can find meaning in their work.
Develop employee careers and achieve business goals: Developing your personnel is the key to expanding a business. A single goal management methodology, data insights, and time-saving automation tools offer prospects for business expansion and personnel advancement.

Reduced stress: Regular feedback and a consistent, established performance review process can improve employee-employer relationships, enhance communication, and reduce employee anxiety. Employees who have a clearer understanding of expectations, what metrics they’re being reviewed on, and how their performance is affecting the overall business experience less stress ad be more engaged in their day to day work.

Better productivity: Without consistent and formal reviews of employee performance, it’s impossible to identify the gaps that are hindering your employees from doing their best work. It’s not necessary to hire perfect employees; those who have a solid skillset, good experience, and a personality and work ethic that fit your company's culture can be incredible assets. If they lack certain training or need motivation, it’s possible to address these things as part of your performance management process and create the strongest team possible for your organisation.

Better documentation and reduced risk: Businesses have a huge responsibility to be compliant with employment and labour laws. Without proper documentation, you could be at risk for lawsuits or other legal issues if a terminated employee sues your business for unlawful termination or discrimination. Employee reviews and other employee performance documentation help protect your business and ensure that you’re following all necessary and relevant laws.

The total cost per company would be determined by the number of employees registered, so if there are 50 employees enrolled, the monthly compensation cost would be $2 x 50, or $100. It would be $1200 annually, and the 10 best employees in the organisation might each receive an equal share of this money. It may occur every month, every quarter, every two years, or every year.

Every employee's earnings in USDT can now be used to purchase whatever the employees want.
